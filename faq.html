        Q: How will I get to know I am suffering from kidney disease?
OR
Are there any signs o symptoms of kidney disease?</h3>
<p>
10 Importsnt Signs of Kidney Disease
1.You start feeling more tired and are have trouble concentrating on your work due to the formation of
toxins and impurities in the blood (especially in severe cases).
2.You'll start facing difficulty in sleeping because the kidneys aren't filtering properly & toxins stay in the
blood rather than leaving the body through the urine.
3.If you have dry and itchy skin.Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease that
often accompanies advanced kidney disease, when the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right
balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood.
4.A poor appetite is a very general symptom.
5.if there is a constant puffiness around your eyes which can be due to the leaking of a large amount of
protein from kidneys in the urine,instead of keeping it in the body.
6.If you feel the need to urinate more often or you urinate frequently, especially at night, this can be a
sign of kidney disease.
7. Excessive bubbles in the urine – especially those that require you to flush several times before they go
away—indicate protein in the urine. This foam may look like the foam you see when scrambling eggs, as
the common protein found in urine, albumin, is the same protein that is found in eggs. This can also be a
sign of kidney disease.
8.If you feel blood coming with urine,this is signaling kidney disease. This happens when the kidney's
filters have been damaged, due to which blood cells can start to "leak" out into the urine.
9.Swelling in the ankles can also be a sign of kidney disease.
10.Cramping of muscles.
Q: If our we are a patient of diabetes ,do we have to get tested for kidney disease?
If you’re at risk for kidney disease due to high blood pressure, diabetes, a family history of kidney failure
or if you’re older than age 60, it’s important to get tested annually for kidney disease. Be sure to
mention any symptoms you’re experiencing to your healthcare practitioner.  </p>
<h3>Q: what actually dialysis is ?
OR


  Q: What is the treatment of kidney disease?</h3>
<p>Dialysis is a most commonly adopted method for kindey diseases. It is a treatment in which wastes and
extra fluids are removed from your blood because your kidneys are unable to filter them effectively.
Q:When is treatment of kidney disease needed?
Your doctor/consultant will advice you exactly when to start treatment according to the condition of
your kidneys.
The decision can based on:
 How much your kidney is functioning
 Symptoms you're having
 Other Health problems you're having
 Nutritional Health</p>
<h3>Q:Which treatment should I choose?</h3>
<p>

  When it comes time to choosing a treatment for kidney disease, it is quite difficult to decide. Learn
more and more about various options available. Consulting your doctor about choosing a right
treatment for you can also help you decide which one is better according to your condition and
personal needs.</p>
<h3>Q:How do I know which treatment is right for me?</h3>
<p>There are usually two treatment available for kidney diseases:
1. Dialysis (Hemodialysis or Peritoneal )
2. Kidney Transplantation.
You can have conversation with your family and take advice from your doctor .This will help you decide
which treatment will best fit your lifestyle and condition of your kidney. Also you always have the choice
to change to a different type of treatment in the future. As your needs and your life change over time,
so may your treatment. However, there may be medical reasons why a particular treatment option is
not right for you, so talk with your health care team or to discuss your personal needs.
Myth:
The only option for receiving dialysis treatment is to travel to a center at least three times per week for
hours at a time.
Fact:
Dialysis can be done in many ways: You can do dialysis in a hospital or an outpatient dialysis clinic or in
your own home. Hemodialysis at a dialysis center is typically done three days per week for four hours at
a time. But you can also do hemodialyis or peritoneal dialysis at home. Learn more about each dialysis
option and talk with your healthcare professional about which type of dialysis is best for you.
Myth:
Dialysis is painful.
Fact:
Dialysis treatments should not be painful. If you experience pain during or after treatment you should
tell your healthcare team right away. Some patients may have a drop in their blood pressure that could
lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches or cramps. However, by following your kidney diet and fluid
restrictions these types of side effects can be avoided. If you are on hemodialysis, you may have some
discomfort when the needles are put into your fistula or graft, but most patients report that this gets
easier with time as your arm becomes used to the needles. There are also medications that can be given
to numb the area if needed.
Myth:
Dialysis is a death sentence.
Fact:
Dialysis is a treatment that helps clean your blood of fluid and toxins when your kidneys are no longer
able to do their job well. Needing to start dialysis can feel overwhelming and scary but dialysis
treatments allow you to live.
Myth:
Dialysis is expensive or unaffordable for the normal patient.
Fact:
The federal government pays 80 percent of all dialysis costs for most patients. Private health insurance
or state medical aid also helps with the costs. It is important to get and keep adequate insurance
coverage. There may be resources available to help pay for treatment or costs associated with
treatment. Talk with you social worker or finanical coordinator at your dialysis about options available in
your area.
Myth:
Dialysis patients can't travel.
Fact:
You can travel on dialysis! But it does take some planning. For those on in-center hemodiaylsis, there
are dialysis centers located in every part of the United States and in many foreign countries. Before you
travel, you must make an appointment for dialysis treatments at another center, and send information
about your medical treatment and history. Your facility social worker can help inform you about what
you need. For those on home dialysis - either peritoneal or home hemodialysis - you can work with your
dialysis team to arrange for supplies to be delivered to your destination and most home dialysis
machines are portable and come wiht a traveling case. Traveling on dialysis is all about being prepared -

Myth:
Dialysis patients do not have the time or energy to work.
Fact:
Many dialysis patients continue to work, go to school, or volunteer. Some take time off when they first
start dialysis treatment and back to work or school after they have gotten used to dialysis. Talk with
your dialysis care team about finding a schedule that fits your needs. Consider dialysis at home for an
even more flexibility and independence.
Myth:
Dialysis patients have no say in their treatment.
Fact:
You are the most important part of your dialysis care team. Each person is unique so be sure to share
how you feel and what your goals are with your healthcare team. Sometimes it is easier to talk with your
healthcare team off the dialysis unit floor, so don't be afraid to ask for a private meeting. Also, patients
have a Bill of Rights which includes quality care, privacy, medical information, social work and dietary
counseling. If you feel your concerns are not being addressed, you can file a grievance with your local
ESRD Network.
Myth:
As a dialysis patient, I worry I will be a burden to my family.
Fact:
Many people with a chronic disease feel this way at some point. Your role in your family may change
over time, but it is important to remember that you are more than your kidney disease or dialysis
treatment! Ask for help when you need it and help others when you can. Be open and honest with your
loved ones about how you are feeling and give yourself the space and time you need to adjust to dialysis
treatments. Once you adjust to your "new normal" on dialysis you will find you will be able to take on
new roles and responsiblities at home again too.
